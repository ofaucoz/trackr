				<li id="text">
				#Trackr is a single page web application which enables users to track Twitter trends
				geographically by viewing a data layer of tweet locations over a
					Google Map. </br></br>
					The menu on the left hand side allows the user to filter tweets by hashtag, location and date. 
					The filtered tweets appear as markers on the Google Map and the radius region from the selected
					location (if given) is displayed as a blue circle. By clicking one of the markers, information about the tweet is shown,
					such as the	tweet text, username and user profile picture.</br></br>
					Beneath the menu, statistics about the current search are shown, with two bar charts displaying the frequency of
					different languages and origin countries in the tweets.

			<h3> App Architecture </h3>
			<ul>
				<li id="image"><img alt="app map image" src="architecture.png"></li>
				<li id="text">The app follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern,
					ensuring that the model (MySQL database, with tweet data), the controller (Wildfly +
					Hibernate server stack) and the view (HTML5, CSS and Javascript)
					are separated and communicate via clear APIs. <br><br>
					The core HTML5 feature used is Canvas (to draw the selected areas
					onto the map) and the app also make use of the geolocation
					API, semantic markup, the history API and the new 'date' form input type.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li id="text"> <b>Back-end </b> <br><br>
					The back-end's role is to receive AJAX requests from the client, request tweets from the Twitter API,
					write these tweets to the database and return the tweets in JSON format to the client front-end.<br><br>
					The main servlet (the application controller) is the SearchServlet Java class, which delegates tasks
					to the TwitterBuilder Java Class where the bulk of the tweet processing is carried out.<br><br>
					We use Wildfly 10.0 for the server with Hibernate (the persistence) and a MySQL database, with the back-end
					code implemented in Java.
					
					The full back-end Java docs are available <a href="docsLinkHere">here</a>.
					
				</li>
				<li id="text"> <b> Front-end </b> <br><br>
					The front-end has been developed as a single-page interface and is designed to be responsive for a range of
					screen sizes (optimised for desktop browsers and mobile phones). It has been implemented with
					HTML5, CSS and Javascript using the Bootstrap framework.<br><br>
					<i>HTML5.</i> The HTML5 provides the web page structure, separating content into three parts: the menu (for entering
					search criteria), the Google Maps layer, and the statistics charts.<br><br>
					<i>CSS.</i> The CSS provides the styling information for the web page. To achieve a modern, clear and clean
					design, we utilise primarily standard Bootstrap CSS for forms, buttons and other user interface items, as
					these are so commonplace on the Web that users expect a similar style on all web sites. We also added custom
					CSS for certain elements, such as our charts.<br><br>
					<i>JavaScript.</i> The JavaScript code implements the client-side logic of the web app. To ensure the web page remains 
					responsive during searches, the app implements an asynchronous application model with AJAX for communication between the 
					client and server. The JS code validates the user's search input, sends an AJAX request to the server based on this input,
					and processes the JSON response from the server. It also communicates with the Google Maps Javascript API to add tweet markers
					to the map and for geocoding, and the CanvasLayer JS library is used to overlay the map with Canvas graphics (currently a blue
					circle showing the search radius, with room to develop this further). JS also provides the majority of the UI functionality 
					(for example button functionality, charts, and	address autocomplete).<br><br>					
					Tweets are shown as blue markers. Clicking on a marker displays an infowindow with more information about the tweet, and the marker
					color changes to yellow to indicate that it has been selected. The boundaries of the map and zoom level are adjusted for each search
					to ensure the best possible view of the markers.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3> Web technologies used</h3>
			<ul>
				<li id="text"> #trackr is a pure web application (no browser plug-ins)
					which utilises the following web technologies: <br><br>
					<i>Canvas.</i> This is the core HTML5 technology used. A Canvas layer is placed over the Google map so that the search
					radius can be displayed as a blue overlay. The search radius is determined by the location (the center of the circle)
					and the radius entered by the user. The size of the circles can then be increased and decreased to visually explore 
					the locations included by different search radiuses. Multiple circles can be displayed and resized on the map at the same time.
					<br><br>
					<i>Geolocation API.</i> This HTML5 API is used to determine the user's location and enter it into the search location field.<br><br>
					<i>Semantic markup.</i> Semantic markup has been used in the HTML to make the structure of the web page clearer to those examining
					the code. This improves readability for other developers but is most useful for automated parsing of the code, for example
					so that text-to-speech software can determine which sections of a page are most important to the user.<br><br>
					<i>SVG and D3.js</i> We use the D3.js library to draw the two SVG charts (which show the languages and countries represented in the
					tweet results).
					<i>AJAX.</i> The client and server use AJAX to communicate. When the user presses Search, if their input is valid the client generates
					an XMLHttpRequest which is sent to the server. The server queries the Twitter Search API and returns the tweet results as a JSON response.
					Because this process is asynchronous, the page is still responsive whilst the request is in progress.<br><br>
					<i>Google Maps Javascript API.</i> This is used for address autocomplete in the search location field, to geocode tweet
					locations reported by the Twitter Search API, and to add markers to the Google Map at the relevant locations. Each marker has
					an associated Infowindow with the tweet data which is displayed when the marker is clicked on.
					
				</li>
				<li id="text"> 
					<i>Twitter Search API.</i> The server uses this API to request tweets matching the user's search criteria. Unfortunately, the free
					version of the API is very limited (for example, only tweets from the last 7 days can be searched) and returns very poor quality
					location information. Often location information is missing because the Twitter user has chosen not to enable geolocation for privacy reasons.
					In such cases we attempt to fetch a location from the user's profile (their home city), but if this also fails then the tweet cannot be
					plotted on the map. There are also cases where coordinates are returned but are clearly incorrect, for example a tweet about someone's day
					shopping in London with coordinates in Antarctica. Erroneous coordinates from Antarctica were, bizarrely, so common that the client does not
					plot these tweets on the map as there is a high probability the location is incorrect.<br><br>
				<i>MySQL.</i> #trackr uses a MySQL database to store the retrieved tweets. MySQL was chosen because it integrates well
				with Hibernate. For simplicity the database schema closely corresponds to the structure of the JSON objects returned by the Twitter search API, 
				with separate tables for tweets, users, entities, coordinates and metadata.	The intention of the database is to enable more advanced statistics, 
				data analysis (for example sentiment analysis of tweets and historical trend timelines), user profiles and query caching (to avoid reaching 
				API request limits) if the project was developed further. Because of the low number of tweets available with the free Twitter Search API, 
				database management is currently very straightforward and the storage requirements are low. However, if deploying this application publicly 
				and/or using one of the paid search APIs, this would require further development. Importantly, this detailed project documentation would 
				also not be made available to the public, because certain details (such as the exact structure of the database) could be used by hackers to exploit the system.

			<h3> Discussion</h3>
			<ul>
				<li id="text">
				<i>Challenges:</i> The back-end development was challenging as most of the team had no experience of back-end
				web development. A great deal of time (>50hrs) was spent trying to resolve various database issues, including
				incompatible character encodings (even with the character encoding set to utf8mb4 mySQL
				could not store emoji on Windows, whereas this was possible on Linux - we found no solution for this other than workarounds for
				Windows to remove emoji characters) and database session/connection management. We also found working with the Twitter Search API
				quite challenging. It is not a complex API and is well documented, but does not appear to function as claimed in the documentation!
				We were unable to resolve our issues with fetching tweets from specific locations, as the API continues to return tweets from far
				outside of the specified location radius.<br><br>
				<i>What went well:</i> In comparison to the back-end, the front-end development was quite straightforward. Using Bootstrap and the Searchable
				Map Template gave us an excellent base to develop from. The template was only used for the webpage layout, with the vast majority of Javascript
				code written from scratch (for example the search input verification, reset button popup, project documentation overlay, graphs, AJAX requests and
				JSON tweet processing). The CanvasLayer library from Google was an exception to this; handling the projection of graphics onto the map proved to be
				quite complex and this library provides an elegant solution.<br><br></li>
