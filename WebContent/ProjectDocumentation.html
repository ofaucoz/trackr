				#Trackr is a single page web application which enables users to track Twitters trends
					geographically by displaying a data layer of tweet locations over a
					Google Map. </br></br>
					The menu on the left hand side allows the user to filter tweets by hashtag, location and time/date to
					track and display them in the Google Map. The filtered tweets appear as markers inside the selected
					region, colored in blue. By clicking one of the markers, information about the tweet is shown:
					tweet text, Tweter's username and picture</br></br>
					In addition, the chart under the menu displays a comparison of number of tweets per location.
					//I will put a different photo (or photos) that shows the performance of the final app

			<h3> App Architecture </h3>
			<ul id="box">
				<li id="image" align = "right"><img alt="app map image" src="architecture.png"></li>
				<li id="text">The app follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern,
					ensuring that the model (MySQL database, with Tweet data), the controller (Wildfly +
					Hibernate server stack) and the view (HTML5, CSS and Javascript)
					are separated and communicate via clear APIs. <br><br>
					The core HTML5 feature used is Canvas (to draw the selected areas
					onto the map) and the app also make use of the geolocation
					API and semantic markup.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li id="text"> <b>Back end </b> <br><br>
					The back end goal in this project is to take the tweets from the twitter API,
					instantiate it as an object and send it to both front end and database (for further analysis
					and to retrieve previous tweets for users). <br><br>
					To do so, it has been used: <br>
					The ressources that are made to replicate the JSON object from the twitter API response. <br>
					A TwitterBuilder that will basically handle everything from querying to create objects and then putting
					it inside the database. <br>
					The servlet class used to make the connection between the front end and the
					back end. <br><br>
					For the back end setup, has been used Wildfly (as a server) with Hibernate (the persistence)
					and MySQL database. The whole back end is written in Java.
				</li>
				<li id="text"> <b> Front end </b> <br><br>
					The front end has been developed has a single-page interface designed to be responsive for a range of
					screen sizes (optimised for desktops browsers and mobile phones). It has been implemented with
					HTML5, CSS and Javascript (using Bootstrap framework).  <br><br>
					<i>HTML5.</i> The HTML5 is designed to organize the web page content in three parts: the menu (for filtering
					the tweets), the Google Maps layer and the chart, where the data is displeyed. It also contains the
					links to the style sheet, JavaScript, Canvas and the Bootstrap libraries.<br><br>
					<i>CSS.</i> The CSS implements the style of the web page. In order to achieve a modern, clear and clean
					design, Columbus Team has chosen a BootstrapCDN template for forms, buttons and other user
					interface items. <br><br>
					<i>JavaScript.</i> The JavaScript code allows the client's interaction with the app. It uses the client's
					requirements (location, time and hashtag) to display the data onto the map layer and the chart.
					Everytime that a research is done, the desired location is shown in the map with a canvas blue cercle.
					Inside this cercle, the filtered tweets appear as blue markers. It is possible to select any of these
					markers to get further information about the tweet. In order to make sure about which tweet is selected,
					the marker change its colour to yellow when it is clicked. Furthermore, JavaScript ensures the total
					data overview by changing the boundaries of the map layer after every research. The client can also
					choose between two different map themes.<br>
					In order to make the web page feel more responsive, an asynchronous application model with AJAX and JS
					has been implemented. The code is also prepared to reset the information on the Google Maps layer (by clicking
					the reset button) and to display an error message if there is any issue during its performance.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3> Highlight used technologies </h3>
			<ul>
				<li id="text"> #trackr is a pure web application (no browser Plug-ins)
					that uses different Web Technologies: <br><br>
					<i>Canvas.</i> The core HTML5 technology used is canvas. It has been implemented to encircle
					dynamically the desired locations that filter the tweets. The menu on the left hand side allows the user
					to choose where the center is going to be placed and the km of its radius. According to the client requirements,
					afterwards it is also possible to increase and decrease the radius of every circle. <br><br>
					<i>Geolocation API.</i> Google Maps Geolocation API collects the information of tweet's geolocation and
					displays it onto a maps layer with markers. Furthermore, the InfoWindows object of Google Maps API
					shows the tweets content in a pop-up window.<br><br>
					<i>Semantic markups.</i> The semantic markups has been used through the implementation of the HTML structure
					to clearly describe the meaning of the content of the web. Therefore, elements as <'nav'>,<'h4'>
					or <'figure'> has been used to reinforce the semantics of the information, rather than to define its
					presentation.<br><br>
					<i>D3js chart.</i> #trackr has implemented D3js JavaScript library to draw the chart using SVG.
					//ASK GASPAR OR CATH HOW IT WAS IMPLEMENTED
					The chart displays a comparison of number of tweets per location.<br><br>
					<i>AJAX.</i> In order to increase the web page's interactivity, speed and usability, an
					asynchronous application model has been implemented. Therefore, the Map layer can be updated
					dynamically and without need to be reloaded if there are new tweets.<br><br>
				</li>
				<li id="text"> #trackr is using a database (MySQL database), which stores data from recent searches and
				consequently, the number of API calls can be reduced. This fact is essentail because of the limit of tweets
				that the application can retrieve, so if it is needed to do an analysis or if an user is using the same
				hashtag often, there is not need to require it. <br><br>
				The model of the database is pretty simple as it uses the same model as the JSON Object from twitter API,
				a Tweet object (the first table) containing an User Object (a second table) and an Entities
				Object (a third table). <br><br>
				The choice of MySQL as a database was made because of the good connection with Hibernate.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3> During the implementation </h3>
			<ul>
				<li id="text"> <b> What went well </b> <br><br>
					The Front-end UI has been easy to develop with HTML5 APIs, CSS and JavaScript, due to the
					intuitive way to write this code and the big community of web developers, information
					and tutorials that can be found on the web.
				</li>
				<li id="text"> <b> Challenges </b> <br><br>
					During the project implementation, the Team has face three main challenges: <br><br>
					Time management with 6+ competing other projects. <br><br>
					Extract location from tweets. During the testing face, was noted that Twitter often
					reports inaccurate coordinates (seems that many of the Tweets come from the Antarctica!)
					or there was not even available location. <br><br>
					Database issues. It has been spent more than 50 hours, but it has not been possible todo
					resolve the issues with characters encoding on Windows (MySql utf8 vs utf8mb4) and also
					sessions and connections management.
				</li>
				<li id="text"> <b> Ideas for extending the project </b> <br><br>
					Because of lack of time (and money), some of the Team ideas or interesting resources
					for #trackr could not been implemented. Some exemples are: <br><br>
					More advanced tweet analytics (stats and graphs). <br><br>
					Use other Twitter APIs. Premium and Enterprise Search APIs allow access to 30 days of
					tweets or the entire tweet timeline. Also trends and random sampling. <br><br>
					Implement user profiles.
